										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The planning stages</h3>
<p>Before you buy a camera and create a website, you’ll want to do a little prep work.</p>
<h2>1. Write a photography business plan</h2>
<p>For starters, wedding and event <a href="https://www.understandphotography.com/peggy-farren/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photographer Peggy Farren</a> says <a href="https://articles.bplans.com/how-to-write-a-business-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you need a business plan</a>. Any serious entrepreneur will tell you that you need to organize your thoughts on paper. This detailed document serves as your roadmap, describing what your business is and how it will be profitable. It breaks down things like <a href="https://articles.bplans.com/cash-flow-101-the-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cash flow</a>, expenses, ownership, and competition.</p>
<p>“Photography is one of the most competitive businesses out there,” Farren says. “You need to be a very good business person to make a decent living. You’ll get there much more quickly if you start out right.”</p>
<p>Creating a business plan may seem like a daunting task, but it doesn’t have to be if you have the right tools. Check out this free, downloadable <a href="https://www.bplans.com/photography_studio_business_plan/executive_summary_fc.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sample photography business plan</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Assess your photography business startup costs</h2>
<p>As part of your business planning process, you’ll need to <a href="https://articles.bplans.com/estimating-realistic-start-up-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assess your startup costs</a>. What are the essentials that you’ll need before you can really launch your business?</p>
<p>Camera equipment alone can cost upwards of $10,000, Farren says. You’ll also need <a href="https://articles.bplans.com/how-and-where-to-obtain-business-licenses-and-permits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business licenses</a>, insurance, a website, and accounting software like <a href="https://pln.rs/qbpas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuickBooks</a> or <a href="https://www.xero.com/us/?xtid=x30liveplan&amp;utm_source=liveplan&amp;utm_medium=cobranded_page&amp;utm_campaign=try_xero_free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xero</a>.</p>
<p>What about a studio?</p>
<p>Do you plan to start with a dedicated studio space or work out of your home? If you need office space, you’ll need to investigate commercial rental properties and figure that monthly cost, along with the cost of utilities, into <a href="https://articles.bplans.com/the-key-elements-of-the-financial-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your financial plan</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Secure startup funds</h2>
<p>If you have enough money in your bank account to start your business you may not need to borrow money, but many entrepreneurs need assistance. Many people who are <a href="https://articles.bplans.com/starting-a-business/">starting a business</a> for the first time end up asking family or friends for help, or keeping their day job until their business is self-sustaining.</p>
<p>Whether you<a href="https://articles.bplans.com/how-to-ask-friends-and-family-to-fund-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> ask friends and family for financial assistance </a>or <a href="https://articles.bplans.com/how-to-secure-a-business-loan-tips-from-a-banking-executive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apply for a bank loan</a>, you’ll need a business plan in place that lays out how you’ll spend the funds and when or how you’ll pay your lenders back.</p>
<h2>4. Figure out your personal finances</h2>
<p>If you’re just starting out, realize that your business probably isn’t going to be profitable overnight. It took 18 months for Farren’s business to <a href="https://articles.bplans.com/break-even-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">break even</a> and make enough money to pay the bills. Like Farren, you might have to work another job to make ends meet until your business is generating enough money.</p>
<h2>5. Get professional experience</h2>
<p>You’ll need to show your prospective clients what you can do, and working alongside a professional photographer is a great way to get some experience and start to build a portfolio. Farren worked as a photographer’s assistant while starting her own business.</p>
<p>Equally important is using that experience to put together a <a href="https://expertphotography.com/create-a-photography-portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photography portfolio</a> that demonstrates your skill. Consider your audience and build the portfolio around what they want to see. Keep it updated, so new potential clients can see current and relevant work.</p>
<h2>6. Buy camera gear</h2>
<p>When it comes to camera gear, Farren says you’ll need two cameras, two high-quality lenses, two flashes, and Photoshop and Lightroom to edit the images. Why two cameras? You need backup equipment. Even new equipment breaks, Farren says.</p>
<p>If you buy used gear, you can get everything for about $5,000, but Farren says $10,000 is more realistic. Of course, you can always upgrade gear as you go.</p>
